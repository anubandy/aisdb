    "The signal data was obtained by reading digitized polygraphic EDF (European Data Format) files. EDF is a standard format for distributing polygraphic data and the source files record various measurements about the sleep study including the signals produced by chest and abdominal inductance belts which indicate the respective breathing patterns. The EDF files were accompanied by annotations in XML format that indicate various encodings such as sleep stage and hypypnea and apnea respiratory events.\n",

Additionally, the following steps were run on two samples, one with only the awake sections removed and a second where all respiratory events were additionally removed.

This fundamental frequency indicates the average respiratory period of the signal.

Within this sliding window we check the signals for various conditions that indicate noise, removing them from the final asynchrony calculation.\n",
